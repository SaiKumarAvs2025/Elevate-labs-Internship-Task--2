Phishing Email Analysis Summary:

I performed a detailed analysis of a suspicious phishing email that contained four hyperlinks, each redirecting users to fake login pages designed to steal credentials. The links were disguised with legitimate-looking anchor text to deceive recipients and increase the chances of interaction. Upon inspection, the URLs pointed to non-reputable domains that are commonly associated with phishing activity.

As part of the investigation, I conducted an email header analysis using MXToolbox to trace the email's source and validate its authenticity. The analysis revealed inconsistencies in SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records, indicating that the email may have been spoofed or sent from an unauthorized mail server. Additionally, the originating IP address was found to be listed on known blacklists, further confirming the email's malicious intent.

This exercise enhanced my practical skills in email threat detection, header analysis, and phishing identification, which are essential for a SOC Analyst role.
